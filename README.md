# Real Time Bus Tracker

### Description

A real-time bus tracker for the buses moving between MIT and Harvard. This program accesses real-time data for actual buses in Boston, Massachusetts along a bus route between MIT and Harvard University, giving each bus a different colored marker, plotting each marker on a map, and updating the locations of these buses every 15 seconds.

**Improvements:** 
- Each bus marker has been given a different color in order to distinguish between the buses.
- Each bus has also been given a pop-up identifying bus number as to also distingusih between the buses.
- The button has been re-styled with rounded edges and to change colors when the cursor is hovered over it.

### How to Run

1. Download the zip file in github and load **index.html** in a browser.
2. Click **"Show bus locations"** the browser window to start the program. 

### Roadmap of Future Improvements

- **Toggle Bus Locations:** I plan on making the button to show bus locations toggle the bus locations instead. This way, the user can start and stop the accessing of data and wipe the markers off the page when they are finished.
- **Check Number of Buses:** I plan on improving the program so it checks the number of buses on each iteration and removes and adds markers accordingly. I also plan to attach specific markers to the specific bus so users can see which bus actually has been added or removed.
- **Bus Tracking:** I plan to create tracking lines to show the path that each bus is taking as it moves throughout the city.
